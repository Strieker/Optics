# Optics
Optics is a game that tests a user's reflexes and ability to withstand visual chaos. The goal is to avoid as many moving obstacles within the canvas as possible by scrolling one's mouse to beat a high score. Every time a user hits a moving obstacle, his or her health decreases. Health can be viewed on a blue progress bar at the top of the game. The longer the user can keep his or her health from reaching 0, the better his or her current score will be, and the more likely his or her current score will override his or her high score. The user can increase or decrease the level of dificulty of the game by changing the colors of the moving objects by hitting the spacebar. I created this game as my final project for Loyola Marymount University's CMSI-185 Section 04 Course, and I enjoyed every minute of the process. I was the sole collaborator on this project, and I utilized HTML + CSS and Javascript to create the program.
